Bot accounts can be created through the applications page, and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the Real Time Gateway.\n__Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found.__"\n\n_- Jaytron (Discord Trust&Safety)_\nsource: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-';
